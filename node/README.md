First, edit the .env.example file to input some test private keys and your infura endpoint ID, and rename the file to just .env

Ideally, you would run this codebase in 3 separate terminals.

First, run it just in one single terminal to create the vault for the 3 terminals/signer to interact with.

Run it again to perform 'pre-registration' for each signer.

Then, once at the automatic registration step, run this code in each terminal to perform the automatic registration.

Then choose one terminal to run the codebase in to complete the vault. (We assume signer1)
